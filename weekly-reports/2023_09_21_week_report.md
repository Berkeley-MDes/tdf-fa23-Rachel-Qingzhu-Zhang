## Summary ##
This week I improved my cellphone stand redesign (with the help of the feedback from my cohorts).

I did not actually print my project in the video presentation session and in my feedback I saw that most of my cohorts in my group strongly suggested that I should print it out (I really appreciate that they love my design!), so i devote a great deal of time for 3D printing.

(1)The first result:
The first 3D printing result is not satisfying because I chose the configuration file for fast printing (fast but not in good quality) on the 3D printer, so the details were not printed well. Also, the slot is a little narrow, so it is hard to securely support the phone.

(2)The second result:
So I changed the size parameters in Grasshopper for better fitting the phone, and re-print my project in a finest configuration. The result looks nice and cute!

1ÔºâTo address the first issue, I modified the stand to allow horizontal phone placement. 

2ÔºâFor the second, I created a slot at the base and front, ensuring ease of charging. 

3ÔºâAnd for a fun twist, I gave the stand some character by adding cute ears and a tail, making it a lovely shape of a cat. 
It's not just functional ‚Äì it's also engaging!  I love cats, (who doesn‚Äôt?) üê±

## Reflection ##
For challenge, I think there are two major challenging things:

First, Conceptualizing ways to enhance the stand was tricky. 

I recognized the limitations of not being able to charge the phone or place it horizontally, but I believe there's still room for added features. (I‚Äôm eager for suggestions!)


Second, From a design standpoint, integrating the modifications was a challenge. 
I heavily utilized Boolean set operations such as union, intersection, and difference sets.

Especially when working on the battery connections, the geometric logic could get perplexing, mainly because Grasshopper has numerous connection lines which can be overwhelming.

## Speculation ##
For speculation, I envision some fascinating enhancements. 
Imagine integrating smart sensors that adjust the phone's angle based on the user's posture. 
This isn't just a convenience; it's the future of personalized ergonomics.
And then, there's the vast potential of Artificial Intelligence. 
Features such as ambient light sensing could be added. Maybe even simple break reminders? 
These additions would transform a basic stand into a multifunctional tool, bridging the gap between simplicity and innovation.


Given that this was my first time using Rhino+Grasshopper for design, I've had a steep learning curve. I delved deep into tutorials, hands-on exercises, and note-taking. If I were to rate my level,  I'd say I'm at a 2 (the Platypus)
