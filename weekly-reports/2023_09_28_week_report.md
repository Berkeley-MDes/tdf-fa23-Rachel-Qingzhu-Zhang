**Weekly Report**

This week, I worked through Sudhu's tutorial and successfully set up the hardwire device, Proton2. In exploring its functionalities, I discovered several interesting features and capabilities of the device. The toolkit accompanying Proton2 is comprehensive, with a wide array of components and gadgets that I am eager to delve into further.

With my background in Arduino, both in project creation and instruction, much of the setup process felt intuitive. However, there were noticeable differences between Proton and Arduino. Some of these differences include:

1. **Platform Integration**: While Arduino primarily focuses on standalone microcontroller boards, Proton2 offers more integrated solutions for specific applications.
  
2. **Software Environment**: The Proton2 environment might be tailored to a different user experience than the Arduino IDE, with unique libraries or functions optimized for its hardware.

3. **Hardware Design**: There might be variations in the physical design, pin configurations, or onboard components between Proton2 and typical Arduino boards.

4. **Connectivity Options**: Proton2 could offer more advanced or varied connectivity options, supporting newer protocols or interfaces compared to some Arduino models.

In conclusion, my week was largely dedicated to setting up and exploring Proton2. I anticipate that my familiarity with Arduino will be an asset as I dive deeper, even as I navigate the unique aspects of the Proton platform.


## Reflection:

Last week, I stepped in to help Junjie with some coding and circuit challenges. Using my Arduino experience, I showed her how to connect wires and explained the basics of circuit connections. We also spent some time debugging together. I'm glad I could assist, and it felt good to meet my own expectations. My background with Arduino definitely made things smoother. It's always rewarding to share knowledge and collaborate.

Also, I appreciated Fareha's help this week. She guided me through the setup of proton 2 and clarified Wi-Fi configurations. This knowledge was helpful when we discussed IoT, giving us a clearer understanding of interconnected devices and their potential applications.
