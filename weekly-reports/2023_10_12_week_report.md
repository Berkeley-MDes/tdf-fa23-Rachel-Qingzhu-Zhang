# Report 7 - Week of 10/05/2023-10/12/2023 #
## Rachel Qingzhu Zhang

This week brought forth an enriching experience as I had the privilege of mentoring Charlene (Mingchen) Lu in acquainting her with the software, Processing. We carved out a small "office hour" for ourselves in a cozy corner of the local cafe, diving into the fundamental principles of coding. The topics of our session spanned variables, functions/methods, class structures, serial communication, and establishing a connection to Arduino, among other essential concepts. To facilitate a better understanding, I utilized slides from my previous projects and sketched graphs which seemed to enhance the clarity of the concepts discussed.

The session unraveled smoothly, and as I elucidated the coding logic, I could see the tendrils of understanding weaving through Charlene's responses. The interaction was not just a transfer of knowledge, but a reciprocal exchange of ideas. Charlene’s inquisitiveness kept the momentum going, making the learning process enjoyable and engaging. 

As we wrapped up our cafe rendezvous, Charlene expressed her gratitude by sharing some snacks, which added a sweet note to the productive day. The sense of achievement that coursed through me was invigorating. It wasn’t just about the coding session, but the camaraderie shared amongst our cohort that made this experience truly rewarding. The joy of seeing a peer grasp new concepts, coupled with the casual, friendly ambiance of our "office hour" made me look forward to more of such insightful interactions. The spirit of collaborative learning within our cohort not only enriches our collective knowledge but also fosters a sense of community and support that I cherish greatly.

Sounds play a crucial role in our lives, and music, in particular, has the power to help us relax and strengthen connections within our community. During our discussion, we explored topics such as formal music education, musical instruments, community engagement, and the therapeutic value of music. Our exchange of ideas extended to the impact of digital technology on music production and distribution, exploring how modern tools have democratized the musical landscape, allowing more people to create and share their artistry. We also touched upon the cultural significance of music, how it forms an intrinsic part of social movements and historical narratives. While we had different ideas about the ways to interact, we all agreed on the technical aspects of our project, and looked forward to delving deeper into the interdisciplinary nature of music, blending the technical, social, and creative aspects into our collaborative endeavor.

We finally came up with the idea of integrating pillow-fighting game into the process of creating music, sounds crazy right? While our idea was surprisingly appreciated by the instructors. Now we are going to delve into the sensors, and figure out a decent and cool way of presenting our music!
