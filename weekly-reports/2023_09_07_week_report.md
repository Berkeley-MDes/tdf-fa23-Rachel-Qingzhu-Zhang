# Report 2 - Week of 08/31/2023-09/07/2023 #
### *Rachel Qingzhu Zhang* ###

## Summary ##
This week included a holiday break, which meant that our regular TDF class on Monday was off. So during the long weekend, I took the initiative to brush up and expand upon what we'd learned in our previous session. I did this by watching TJ’s tutorials and by seeking additional references and materials on computational design.

## Reflection ##

I endeavored to grasp the essence of computational design: its primary objectives, underlying principles, and the requisite skills one needs to launch a successful computational design product. While I realized that there's a vast array of knowledge yet to be uncovered, I am confident that I've found a solid starting point. And here are the brief summary of computational design:


  >**Algorithmic Thinking**: Designers use algorithms or rules to generate or modify designs, rather than crafting each element manually.

  >**Parametric Design**: Design decisions are based on set parameters and rules. Adjusting these parameters allows for automatic design updates.

  >**Simulation and Optimization**: Predictive simulations help anticipate design performance under specific conditions. This enables iterative design refinement.

  >**Generative Design**: By setting goals and constraints, algorithms generate diverse design solutions. Designers set criteria and choose the best output.

  >**Interactivity**: Computational design can create adaptive designs, responding in real-time to the environment or user inputs.

  >**Integration of Data**: Computational design leverages data both to inform the design process and in structures that interact with data.

  >**Machine Learning and AI**: Advanced techniques predict behaviors, optimize outputs, or create new design solutions.

  >**Digital Fabrication**: Methods like 3D printing and CNC milling translate computational designs directly into physical forms


  **Seeking Inspiration:**
  I've embarked on the quest to find inspiration for the first project's topic. My exploration led me to dive into creative portfolios on Behance, and I spent some time watching related videos on YouTube, and also the Design in Tech Report from 2017 shared in MDes wiki.

  **Hands-On Experience:**
  Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience by delving into Learning Rhino & Grasshopper, again with the aid of TJ’s invaluable tutorials.

## Speculation ##
The concept of computational design has captivated me. Its depth and intricacies extend beyond what I've learned previously.
As I look forward, my ultimate aspiration is to immerse myself in the intricate world of Rhino, Grasshopper, Cloud Compute, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
