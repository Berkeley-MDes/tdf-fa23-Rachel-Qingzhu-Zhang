## Summary ##
This week I did my project 1: my cellphone stand redesign. I started by examining the original cellphone stand, and after some time, I pinpointed two primary issues:

1）It didn’t allow for horizontal placement of the phone. 

2）It lacked a dedicated charging slot.

So, what did I do? 

1）To address the first issue, I modified the stand to allow horizontal phone placement. 

2）For the second, I created a slot at the base and front, ensuring ease of charging. 

3）And for a fun twist, I gave the stand some character by adding cute ears and a tail, making it a lovely shape of a cat. 
It's not just functional – it's also engaging!  I love cats, (who doesn’t?) 🐱

## Reflection ##
For challenge, I think there are two major challenging things:

First, Conceptualizing ways to enhance the stand was tricky. 

I recognized the limitations of not being able to charge the phone or place it horizontally, but I believe there's still room for added features. (I’m eager for suggestions!)


Second, From a design standpoint, integrating the modifications was a challenge. 
I heavily utilized Boolean set operations such as union, intersection, and difference sets.

Especially when working on the battery connections, the geometric logic could get perplexing, mainly because Grasshopper has numerous connection lines which can be overwhelming.

## Speculation ##
For speculation, I envision some fascinating enhancements. 
Imagine integrating smart sensors that adjust the phone's angle based on the user's posture. 
This isn't just a convenience; it's the future of personalized ergonomics.
And then, there's the vast potential of Artificial Intelligence. 
Features such as ambient light sensing could be added. Maybe even simple break reminders? 
These additions would transform a basic stand into a multifunctional tool, bridging the gap between simplicity and innovation.


Given that this was my first time using Rhino+Grasshopper for design, I've had a steep learning curve. I delved deep into tutorials, hands-on exercises, and note-taking. If I were to rate my level,  I'd say I'm at a 2 (the Platypus)
