### Summary
This week I finished our project, Alystama

‚ÄúAlystama,‚Äù our prototype, is a Kazakh culture-inspired device designed to maintain emotional connections in long-distance
relationships. It features traditional ‚Äútumar‚Äù patterns and utilizes buttons, NeoPixel LEDs for various light effects, and a haptic
vibration motor to create distinctive vibration modes for responses. This functional prototype embodies the essence of being ‚Äòno
longer apart,‚Äô merging tactile, visual, and cultural elements to foster a unique sense of closeness across distances.

the detailed info are in our video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8p8QGR5bmQ

and my project report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19r3ghCS2niy-01e1O4nRgogJXURsQ_aJVfTYlG7qZ_c/edit

### Speculation: 
Working on this project has been a truly enjoyable experience for me, particularly those exhilarating moments when everything came together - the lights turned on, and the devices connected seamlessly. To be honest, the days leading up to the showcase involved a lot of late nights. Those sleepless hours spent in Jacobs Hall at Berkeley are moments I'll always cherish. The sense of happiness and accomplishment that came after overcoming numerous failures and setbacks was unparalleled.

An interesting aspect of this journey was naming our project. Actually, it was me who chose the name of our project (in Kazakh), thanks to the cultural insights I gained from Baurzhan. The name, which translates to "Don‚Äôt Drift Apart," felt particularly fitting. Baurzhan opened a window for me into the rich tapestry of Kazakh culture, sharing his knowledge about their language, music, art, and social environment. This experience was enlightening; I learned so much and felt a deep sense of achievement and joy in acquiring this knowledge. Before MDes program, I knew next to nothing about this fascinating land. To me, the most valuable aspect of this project has been this cultural exploration, something I could never have experienced working solo.

**The semester ends with sense of happiness for best memories and sadness for being apart. I will miss our TDF crew guys: TJ, Sudhu, Jeff and Shm.
I hope our project's concept will last long: Don't drift apart guys!**

### Summary: Team up with Baurzhan Abenov and came up with the design demo prototype

This week, I teamed up with Baurzhan Abenov to develop a unique project: a communication device aimed at bridging the gap in long-distance relationships. I find this concept fascinating to be a perfect blend of romance and practicality. Baurzhan's vision, inspired by traditional Middle Asian culture, particularly captivated me with its unique blend of art and technology.

Baurzhan introduced me to an exquisite aspect of Kazakh culture - the Tumar, a traditional form of Kazakh handcraft artwork. Its intricate designs and patterns reminded me of similar traditional Chinese motifs, creating a fascinating cultural connection.

We mapped out our roles meticulously. Baurzhan would take the lead on the initial stages of the project: crafting early prototypes, engaging in detailed handcrafting, and handling the laser cutting processes. His focus would be on infusing our device with the aesthetic essence of Kazakh artistry. On my end, I'm diving into the technical aspects. This involves programming light effects and vibration patterns, which are key to the device's functionality. However, the core of my responsibility lies in developing the communication features - ensuring that our device not only looks good but also serves its purpose effectively.

### Speculation

### Summary: Pitch On Project 4

This week i presented two of my ideas on my final project. One is a more practical project: Digital Plate for Eating Disorders and Fitness, the other one is Prism: Wearable device for poly-music composition and visualization

For the first idea,it aims to develop an innovative digital plate designed to assist individuals with eating disorders and fitness enthusiasts. The plate will incorporate advanced technology to aid in managing eating habits and nutritional intake. 

the functions are:

Color-Changing Technology:
- Utilizes materials that change color to influence appetite and eating behavior.
- Aimed at creating a psychological impact on food consumption.

Nutrient Ratio Displays (Carbs/Fat/Protein/Fiber...):
- The plate will have designated partitions to display different nutrient ratios.
- Assists in meal planning for a balanced diet.

Companion App for Tracking and Analysis:
- A user-friendly app to track eating habits and nutritional intake.
- Features include meal logging, nutritional analysis, and progress tracking.

Detachable Small Saucer:
- Shaped like a cat's earüê±, designed for small snacks or portion control.
- Enhances the plate's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

And my second idea stems from the cover of Pink Floyd's album the dark side of the moon. Why Pink Floyd uses prism as their album cover? I looked up the answer:
- Visual Simplicity and Depth: It represents a transition from simplicity to complexity, much like life's journey.
- Spectrum of Light: The light spectrum in the prism signifies diversity and complexity arising from simplicity, a -metaphor for life's varied experiences and emotions.
- Unity and Dispersion: The light's journey through the prism reflects the album's themes: the stages and struggles of human life, moving from unity to diversity and back.

So inspired by these concept, i came up a device for music collaboration and light projection device, featuring:
- Collaborative Creation: Prisms connect wirelessly for synchronized music and color generation, promoting teamwork.
- Centralized Kaleidoscope Projection: A shared projection system aggregates inputs from multiple prisms, creating a large-scale kaleidoscopic light show in a communal space.
- Interactive Multiplayer Games: Design games or challenges that require collaborative effort to achieve specific musical or visual goals.

## Speculation
Honestly, I am pretty proud about these ideas and really want to realize them. But the time could be limited for i only have less than 3 weeks, and they all have so many functions. So i am seeking advices through cohorts and instructors on the feasibility. I am particularly grateful for the support I've received from Adorey Shen. Although she is not a member of my team, her assistance has been crucial. Adorey offered solid help and suggestions on how to adjust my prototype and fine-tune its functions. Her expertise has provided a fresh perspective, helping me to identify areas for improvement and optimization that I hadn't previously considered.

# Speculations On Project 3

This week, I showcased my model and I am both glad and grateful for the valuable feedback received from our dear cohorts. Additionally, I witnessed an incredible project from Vidit. He created a model named 'Raj,' inspired by his father. Vidit input extensive data about his father, his family, and himself. He describes Raj as a genuine and kind father, always encouraging him, even in the face of mistakes or poor academic performance. The project was presented as a mobile application with multilingual voice recognition. Vidit shared insights on the development and launch process, from which I learned a great deal. Sadly, his father is no longer with us. Vidit's goal is to create a virtual mentor or father figure to comfort those who have lost loved ones or need spiritual support. His project deeply moved me ‚Äì I found myself in tears on the bus reflecting on it. I feel incredibly honored to witness such meaningful projects from our cohort!
For this week, I believe my feedback has helped many of our cohorts enhance their projects. Although we were divided into groups, I made it a point to review the project videos from other groups as well. It seemed a shame to miss out on their amazing work. I assisted Nancy-Yuhe Niu with the OpenAI API for her upcoming project, recognizing the increasing importance of the OpenAI API in our project development. This experience has sparked new ideas about the role of AI-generated works in 'Debates in Design,' which I find very inspiring

# Speculations On Project 2

Our additional functions: here are some optional functions we came up before, we can add these functions in the future for more functional use:

- Button Change Scale/record/save/show Chord
- Incorporating a learning mode where participants can learn about musical concepts through interactive gameplay.
- Allowing users to record, save, and share their musical creations.

Enhanced Sensory Integration: While the current design uses tactile and auditory elements, future iterations could incorporate other senses. Imagine a pillow that changes temperature in sync with the music, or one that emits subtle fragrances based on the tunes played. By appealing to multiple senses simultaneously, the experience becomes even more immersive and therapeutic.

Adaptive Learning Algorithms: With the integration of machine learning, the 'Musical Pillow' could observe and adapt to user preferences over time. For instance, if a user often creates melancholic tunes during rainy days, the pillow could suggest similar tunes or even offer contrasting upbeat melodies to elevate the user's mood during subsequent rainy sessions.

Collaborative Music Creation: In an era of connected devices, the 'Musical Pillow' could communicate with other pillows or musical devices in real-time. Picture a scenario where two friends, miles apart, engage in a 'duet', their respective pillows harmonizing with each other, bridging the physical distance with music.

Environment-responsive Modules: Embedding environment sensors (like temperature, humidity, or light sensors) could make the 'Musical Pillow' responsive to its surroundings. A sunny day might evoke cheerful, upbeat tunes, while a stormy night might result in dramatic, intense melodies.

Integration into the Larger Musical Ecosystem: The pillow, as a musical creation tool, could easily integrate with digital audio workstations (DAWs) or music-sharing platforms. This would allow users to not only create music but also effortlessly record, edit, and share their creations with a wider audience, fostering a community of 'Musical Pillow' composers and enthusiasts.

# Conclusion & Feedback

The 'Musical Pillow' project was more than a mere fusion of technology and music; it was a journey into redefining the boundaries of interactive design and pushing the envelope of what we perceive as play. In confronting and surmounting various challenges, from integrating intricate sensors to decoding the nuances of music theory, I gained invaluable insights into the symbiosis of design, technology, and human interaction. The project stands as a testament to the transformative power of innovation and the endless potential that awaits when we dare to reimagine the familiar. As I reflect on the endeavor, I'm reminded that in a rapidly evolving digital age, there remains an irreplaceable value in tactile experiences, genuine joy, and shared moments of creativity. The 'Musical Pillow' is not just a product‚Äîit's a vision of a future where technology enhances, rather than replaces, the simple joys of human connection.

# Report 8 - Week of 10/12/2023-10/19/2023 #
## Rachel Qingzhu Zhang

This week, we successfully completed our project! This project is exactly as CUTE as my project 1 (do you rememerber the kitten-head phonestand?): a pillow with a fish shape! What is more, it can create music (very nintendo-ish 8-bit electro music)! we use the sensor ADHL362 for the interaction part

The sensor provides six parameters: three axes for the accelerometer and three orientations (roll, pitch, and tilt) for the gyroscope. We utilize the accelerometer axes for rhythm generation, and the gyroscope's roll, pitch, and tilt for crafting melodies.

<img width="600" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.19-0.png">

Creating sound is not a difficult task. While creating music, especially to achieve harmony is more complicated, which requires a deeper understanding of music. Therefore, we explored basic music theory.

<img width="600" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.19-1.png">

In melody creation, the fundamental elements are notes, chords, and scales. A note is the basic unit, a set of notes forms a chord, and a progression of chords creates a scale. For appealing music, it's desirable to have notes structured into chords, with chord progressions adhering to a particular scale. We enriched our understanding of this by engaging with various resources on music theory.

<img width="600" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.19-2.png">

For music programming, we employed Max/MSP. Our primary function is to map each sensor value to the piano's range, which spans from 0 to 88. For instance, when working with the C Major scale, it's necessary to skip certain notes. Therefore, we performed a translation from our available notes to those within the C Major scale. This translation allows us to work with different scales, thereby enabling the creation of various musical styles.

<img width="600" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.19-4.png">

The most challenging aspect involves transmitting data from the Photon to Max via Bluetooth. We opted for Bluetooth over Wi-Fi due to the latter's one-second delay. Using USB cables isn't a viable option while handling our pillow. The process of setting up Bluetooth proved more complex than anticipated. Thanks to Lingxiu's efforts, particularly in handling the technical aspects that involved numerous Python and terminal commands, we are now able to receive the data promptly.

## Rachel Qingzhu Zhang

This week brought forth an enriching experience as I had the privilege of mentoring Charlene (Mingchen) Lu in acquainting her with the software, Processing. We carved out a small "office hour" for ourselves in a cozy corner of the local cafe, diving into the fundamental principles of coding. The topics of our session spanned variables, functions/methods, class structures, serial communication, and establishing a connection to Arduino, among other essential concepts. To facilitate a better understanding, I utilized slides from my previous projects and sketched graphs which seemed to enhance the clarity of the concepts discussed.

The session unraveled smoothly, and as I elucidated the coding logic, I could see the tendrils of understanding weaving through Charlene's responses. The interaction was not just a transfer of knowledge, but a reciprocal exchange of ideas. Charlene‚Äôs inquisitiveness kept the momentum going, making the learning process enjoyable and engaging. 

As we wrapped up our cafe rendezvous, Charlene expressed her gratitude by sharing some snacks, which added a sweet note to the productive day. The sense of achievement that coursed through me was invigorating. It wasn‚Äôt just about the coding session, but the camaraderie shared amongst our cohort that made this experience truly rewarding. The joy of seeing a peer grasp new concepts, coupled with the casual, friendly ambiance of our "office hour" made me look forward to more of such insightful interactions. The spirit of collaborative learning within our cohort not only enriches our collective knowledge but also fosters a sense of community and support that I cherish greatly.


<img width="700" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-a.png">

Sounds play a crucial role in our lives, and music, in particular, has the power to help us relax and strengthen connections within our community. During our discussion, we explored topics such as formal music education, musical instruments, community engagement, and the therapeutic value of music. Our exchange of ideas extended to the impact of digital technology on music production and distribution, exploring how modern tools have democratized the musical landscape, allowing more people to create and share their artistry. We also touched upon the cultural significance of music, how it forms an intrinsic part of social movements and historical narratives. While we had different ideas about the ways to interact, we all agreed on the technical aspects of our project, and looked forward to delving deeper into the interdisciplinary nature of music, blending the technical, social, and creative aspects into our collaborative endeavor.

We finally came up with the idea of integrating pillow-fighting game into the process of creating music, sounds crazy right? While our idea was surprisingly appreciated by the instructors. Now we are going to delve into the sensors, and figure out a decent and cool way of presenting our music!

# Report 6 - Week of 09/29/2023-10/05/2023 #
## Rachel Qingzhu Zhang

Embarking on a musical journey where technology and melody intertwine, our team found a fascinating playground in the realm of Arduino, exploring its potential to morph into a vessel of interactive musical expression.  Music, a universal language, became our medium to communicate, express, and connect, promising not just a project but an experience that resonates across the digital and physical realms.


In our initial brainstorms, the vibrant idea of a "Musical Step Mat" stepped into our creative light.  Picture this: a mat where every step triggers a note, each zone or square emanating a distinct sound, allowing the participant to literally walk through a melody, crafting sounds through motion and presence.  It was more than a concept - it was a canvas where participants could tread, dance, and create their own symphony.


<img width="700" alt="10.5-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-a.png">

Another innovative thread we pulled was marrying environmental stimuli with musical output.  We ideated a system where the ambient light or temperature delicately shapes the sounds produced, crafting an adaptive melody that dances with its surroundings.  Imagine melodies that morph with the breaking dawn or a rhythm that slows with the evening cool.

<img width="700" alt="10.5-b" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-b.png">

We further spun our ideas into a world where gestures sculpt soundscapes.  Envision wielding the power to carve out notes and harmonies through movements, as accelerometers and gyroscopes capture the essence of motion, translating it into a dynamic auditory experience.

<img width="700" alt="10.5-c" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-c.png">

As we delved deeper, our project took form with meticulous crafting, ensuring that each note played was not just heard, but also seen and felt.  A cascade of LEDs provided a visual echo to our melodic inventions, creating a multi-sensory ensemble where sound and light play in unison.

<img width="700" alt="10.5-d" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-d.png">

Within the harmonious marriage of technology and melody, we ensured our system embraced the future, by establishing a modular foundation.  This allowed our musical invention the freedom to evolve, welcoming new components and sensors that might further refine and expand our symphonic explorations.

<img width="700" alt="10.5-e" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/10.5-e.png">

Still on our path, our team navigates through the melodic and technical intricacies, ensuring what we create is not merely a confluence of sounds and technology, but an experience that serenades through every step, gesture, and environmental whisper.  Here‚Äôs to our journey ahead, where we continue to craft, explore, and echo in the infinite realms of digital melody.

## Summary 

my week was largely dedicated to setting up and exploring Photon2. I anticipate that my familiarity with Arduino will be an asset as I dive deeper, even as I navigate the unique aspects of the Photon platform.

This week, I worked through Sudhu's tutorial and successfully set up the hardwire device, Photon2. In exploring its functionalities, I discovered several interesting features and capabilities of the device. The toolkit accompanying Proton2 is comprehensive, with a wide array of components and gadgets that I am eager to delve into further.

With my background in Arduino, both in project creation and instruction, much of the setup process felt intuitive. However, there were noticeable differences between Photon and Arduino. Some of these differences include:

1. **Platform Integration**: While Arduino primarily focuses on standalone microcontroller boards, Photon2 offers more integrated solutions for specific applications.
  
2. **Software Environment**: The Proton2 environment might be tailored to a different user experience than the Arduino IDE, with unique libraries or functions optimized for its hardware.

3. **Hardware Design**: There might be variations in the physical design, pin configurations, or onboard components between Photon2 and typical Arduino boards.

4. **Connectivity Options**: Photon2 could offer more advanced or varied connectivity options, supporting newer protocols or interfaces compared to some Arduino models.

<img width="700" alt="macaddress" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/macaddress.png">

For the first part, is the wifi configuration. I never came across this procedure in Arduino, so I am curious that, what does the MAC Address actually do and why we have to configure the wifi. Then I found its purpose:
  
> Enables internet-based functions, software updates, remote access, and integration with other devices.
  
  and the role of the MAC Address are:
  
> Identification: Acts as a unique identifier for the device on networks.

> Security: Used in MAC filtering for network access control.
> 
> Troubleshooting: Assists in diagnosing connection issues.
> 
>  IP Management: Can influence IP address assignment in some networks.


## Reflection:

Last week, I stepped in to help Junjie with some coding and circuit challenges. Using my Arduino experience, I showed her how to connect wires and explained the basics of circuit connections. We also spent some time debugging together. I'm glad I could assist, and it felt good to meet my own expectations. My background with Arduino definitely made things smoother. It's always rewarding to share knowledge and collaborate.

Also, I appreciated Fareha's help this week. She guided me through the setup of proton 2 and clarified Wi-Fi configurations. This knowledge was helpful when we discussed IoT, giving us a clearer understanding of interconnected devices and their potential applications.

## Summary ##
This week I improved my cellphone stand redesign (with the help of the feedback from my cohorts).

I did not actually print my project in the video presentation session and in my feedback I saw that most of my cohorts in my group strongly suggested that I should print it out (I really appreciate that they love my design!), so i devote a great deal of time for 3D printing.

(1)The first result:
The first 3D printing result is not satisfying because I chose the configuration file for fast printing (fast but not in good quality) on the 3D printer, so the details were not printed well. Also, the slot is a little narrow, so it is hard to securely support the phone.

<img width="700" alt="3" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/3.png">

<img width="700" alt="7" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/7.png">

(2)The second result:
So I changed the size parameters in Grasshopper for better fitting the phone, and re-print my project in a finest configuration. The result looks nice and cute!

## Speculation ##

This project has been an enlightening experience, from pinpointing design challenges to immersing myself in Rhino+Grasshopper tutorials and hands-on work. The redesigned cellphone stand showcases a fusion of design, aesthetics, functionality, and tech. It's rewarding to see my digital designs materialize and become usable in everyday life. 

I really appreciate and cherish the feedback from my cohorts, and it is my pleasure that my project to be liked by most of them. (I am thinking to produce copies for presents to them!)
It really facilitate me in having a deeper understanding in computational design and also presentation skills.

### *Rachel Qingzhu Zhang* ###

* this is my video link: https://youtu.be/aAXmthdqNFg

## Summary ##
This week I did my project 1: my cellphone stand redesign. I started by examining the original cellphone stand, and after some time, I pinpointed two primary issues:

1ÔºâIt didn‚Äôt allow for horizontal placement of the phone. 

2ÔºâIt lacked a dedicated charging slot.


<img width="780" alt="9.14-a" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/9.14-a.png">

So, what did I do? 

1ÔºâTo address the first issue, I modified the stand to allow horizontal phone placement. 

2ÔºâFor the second, I created a slot at the base and front, ensuring ease of charging. 

3ÔºâAnd for a fun twist, I gave the stand some character by adding cute ears and a tail, making it a lovely shape of a cat. 
It's not just functional ‚Äì it's also engaging!  I love cats, (who doesn‚Äôt?) üê±

## Reflection ##
For challenge, I think there are two major challenging things:

First, Conceptualizing ways to enhance the stand was tricky. 

I recognized the limitations of not being able to charge the phone or place it horizontally, but I believe there's still room for added features. (I‚Äôm eager for suggestions!)


Second, From a design standpoint, integrating the modifications was a challenge. 
I heavily utilized Boolean set operations such as union, intersection, and difference sets. 

<img width="780" alt="9.14-f" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/9.14-e.png">

Especially when working on the battery connections, the geometric logic could get perplexing, mainly because Grasshopper has numerous connection lines which can be overwhelming.

<img width="780" alt="9.14-e" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/9.14-e.png">

## Speculation ##
For speculation, I envision some fascinating enhancements. 
Imagine integrating smart sensors that adjust the phone's angle based on the user's posture. 
This isn't just a convenience; it's the future of personalized ergonomics.
And then, there's the vast potential of Artificial Intelligence. 
Features such as ambient light sensing could be added. Maybe even simple break reminders? 
These additions would transform a basic stand into a multifunctional tool, bridging the gap between simplicity and innovation.


Given that this was my first time using Rhino+Grasshopper for design, I've had a steep learning curve. I delved deep into tutorials, hands-on exercises, and note-taking. If I were to rate my level, I'd say I'm at a 2 (the Platypus).

## Summary ##
This week included a holiday break, which meant that our regular TDF class on Monday was off. So during the long weekend, I took the initiative to brush up and expand upon what we'd learned in our previous session. I did this by watching TJ‚Äôs tutorials and by seeking additional references and materials on computational design.

## Reflection ##

I endeavored to grasp the essence of computational design: its primary objectives, underlying principles, and the requisite skills one needs to launch a successful computational design product. While I realized that there's a vast array of knowledge yet to be uncovered, I am confident that I've found a solid starting point. And here are the brief summary of computational design:


  >**Algorithmic Thinking**: Designers use algorithms or rules to generate or modify designs, rather than crafting each element manually.

  >**Parametric Design**: Design decisions are based on set parameters and rules. Adjusting these parameters allows for automatic design updates.

  >**Simulation and Optimization**: Predictive simulations help anticipate design performance under specific conditions. This enables iterative design refinement.

  >**Generative Design**: By setting goals and constraints, algorithms generate diverse design solutions. Designers set criteria and choose the best output.

  >**Interactivity**: Computational design can create adaptive designs, responding in real-time to the environment or user inputs.

  >**Integration of Data**: Computational design leverages data both to inform the design process and in structures that interact with data.

  >**Machine Learning and AI**: Advanced techniques predict behaviors, optimize outputs, or create new design solutions.

  >**Digital Fabrication**: Methods like 3D printing and CNC milling translate computational designs directly into physical forms


  **Seeking Inspiration:**
  I've embarked on the quest to find inspiration for the first project's topic. My exploration led me to dive into creative portfolios on Behance, and I spent some time watching related videos on YouTube, and also the Design in Tech Report from 2017 shared in MDes wiki.

  **Hands-On Experience:**
  Furthermore, I gained hands-on experience by delving into Learning Rhino & Grasshopper, again with the aid of TJ‚Äôs invaluable tutorials.

## Speculation ##
The concept of computational design has captivated me. Its depth and intricacies extend beyond what I've learned previously.
As I look forward, my ultimate aspiration is to immerse myself in the intricate world of Rhino, Grasshopper, Cloud Compute, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

# Report 1 - Week of 08/28/2023 #
### *Rachel Qingzhu Zhang* ###

## Summary ##
This week I learned a lot from obstacles and failure.

First, I cannot adjust the parameters of the holder. If I change the width of the phone into 90mm, the holder will turn red (which may means that the phone intersects with the holder in the sketch). 

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot%202023-08-30%20at%2016.14.28" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Rachel-Qingzhu-Zhang/blob/main/weekly-reports/Screenshot%202023-08-30%20at%2016.14.28.png">

Second, the use of the laser cutting machine is kind of confusing, especially for transmitting the sketches. Then with the instruction of Sudhu, we learned that we have to take a little trial on our board, for preventing problems during the laser cutting process. (The boards are really expensive!) Thanks to Sudhu, I learned a lot of special tricks.

I still have some questions about adjusting parameters and baking. Hope I can figure it out in Thursday‚Äôs class.


## Reflection ##
*Taking the first step is always challenging, just like my academic journey at Berkeley and also, navigating software learning. I aspired to take a bold leap initially, but it proved more difficult than anticipated.*

*When I first launched Grasshopper and was confronted by its intricate, "spaghetti"-like maps and countless parameters, I felt overwhelmed. The mere sight of the interface made me want to shut down my PC immediately. Yet, discovering tutorials on MDes‚Äô GitHub repository gave a glimmer of hope. However, the sheer volume of tutorials ‚Äî with each spanning nearly an hour ‚Äî left me daunted and unsure of where to begin.*

So here is the reflection of how to learn new tools and kicking off a well-planned semester:

1. Get the Big Picture: Before diving in, I like to get a bird's-eye view of the software. Knowing its purpose, understanding its basic interface, and grasping the rationale behind its design can demystify the whole process.  A bit of familiarity can help reduce the initial apprehension and face the challenge with confidence. 

2. Learn by Comparing: Relate new tools to ones you already know.  Drawing parallels between the new and the familiar can be super helpful. (Like understanding Rhino by comparing it to Blender.)

3. Stay Organized: Jot down notes, make sketches, and bookmark important sites (like MDes Github wiki). I also keep my notes sorted into different files to keep my thoughts in order.

4. Ask Away:  It's easy to hold back from asking questions out of fear of being embarrassed or judged. But hey, I remind myself of the tuition I've paid ‚Äî I deserve to get the most out of it! So, I've learned to be bold to ask around seeking clarity and instructions.

5. Value my dear Cohorts: For me, the cohorts are more than just classmates; they're also mentors. I'm proud to be part of such a supportive group, always ready to share and assist. Sometimes, I feel there's more to learn from them than even from our professors.


## Speculation ##
I think the phone holder could be improved in several ways for better practicability:

1) When you're trying to put your phone in the slot, you have to be really careful. If the case is made of a tough material, there's a chance that the phone screen might get scratched if you don't place it just right.

2) There's a problem with the parts of the case that hold the phone. They cover up some parts of the screen. This means when you're trying to record something, you can't see everything clearly because a part of the screen is hidden, so as to watch a video (therefore the using scenarios are very limited).

*like this*

4) The phone holder seems tailored for a specific user and perhaps a particular table. The big issue here is that you can't change the angle of the phone once it's in the holder. This isn't very convenient if you want to adjust the phone's position to get a better view.

*this is my phone stand which can adjust the angles for the view*
