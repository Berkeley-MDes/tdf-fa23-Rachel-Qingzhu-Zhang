Taking the first step is always challenging, just like my academic journey at Berkeley and also, navigating software learning. I aspired to take a bold leap initially, but it proved more difficult than anticipated.

When I first launched Grasshopper and was confronted by its intricate, "spaghetti"-like maps and countless parameters, I felt overwhelmed. The mere sight of the interface made me want to shut down my PC immediately. Yet, discovering tutorials on MDes’ GitHub repository gave a glimmer of hope. However, the sheer volume of tutorials — with each spanning nearly an hour — left me daunted and unsure of where to begin.

## Summary ##
So here are the summary of how to learn new tools and kicking off a well-planned semester:

1. Get the Big Picture: Before diving in, I like to get a bird's-eye view of the software. Knowing its purpose, understanding its basic interface, and grasping the rationale behind its design can demystify the whole process.  A bit of familiarity can help reduce the initial apprehension and face the challenge with confidence. 

2. Learn by Comparing: Relate new tools to ones you already know.  Drawing parallels between the new and the familiar can be super helpful. (Like understanding Rhino by comparing it to Blender.)

3. Stay Organized: Jot down notes, make sketches, and bookmark important sites (like MDes Github wiki). I also keep my notes sorted into different files to keep my thoughts in order.

4. Ask Away:  It's easy to hold back from asking questions out of fear of being embarrassed or judged. But hey, I remind myself of the tuition I've paid — I deserve to get the most out of it! So, I've learned to be bold to ask around seeking clarity and instructions.

5. Value my dear Cohorts: For me, the cohorts are more than just classmates; they're also mentors. I'm proud to be part of such a supportive group, always ready to share and assist. Sometimes, I feel there's more to learn from them than even from our professors.
