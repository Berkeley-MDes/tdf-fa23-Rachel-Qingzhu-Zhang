# Speculations On Project 3

This week, I showcased my model and I am both glad and grateful for the valuable feedback received from our dear cohorts. Additionally, I witnessed an incredible project from Vidit. He created a model named 'Raj,' inspired by his father. Vidit input extensive data about his father, his family, and himself. He describes Raj as a genuine and kind father, always encouraging him, even in the face of mistakes or poor academic performance. The project was presented as a mobile application with multilingual voice recognition. Vidit shared insights on the development and launch process, from which I learned a great deal. Sadly, his father is no longer with us. Vidit's goal is to create a virtual mentor or father figure to comfort those who have lost loved ones or need spiritual support. His project deeply moved me â€“ I found myself in tears on the bus reflecting on it. I feel incredibly honored to witness such meaningful projects from our cohort!

For this week, I believe my feedback has helped many of our cohorts enhance their projects. Although we were divided into groups, I made it a point to review the project videos from other groups as well. It seemed a shame to miss out on their amazing work. I assisted Nancy-Yuhe Niu with the OpenAI API for her upcoming project, recognizing the increasing importance of the OpenAI API in our project development. This experience has sparked new ideas about the role of AI-generated works in 'Debates in Design,' which I find very inspiring
