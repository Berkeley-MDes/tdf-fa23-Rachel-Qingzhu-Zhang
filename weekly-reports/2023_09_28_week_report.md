## Reflection:

Last week, I stepped in to help Junjie with some coding and circuit challenges. Using my Arduino experience, I showed her how to connect wires and explained the basics of circuit connections. We also spent some time debugging together. I'm glad I could assist, and it felt good to meet my own expectations. My background with Arduino definitely made things smoother. It's always rewarding to share knowledge and collaborate.

Also, I appreciated Fareha's help this week. She guided me through the setup of proton 2 and clarified Wi-Fi configurations. This knowledge was helpful when we discussed IoT, giving us a clearer understanding of interconnected devices and their potential applications.
