# Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
***Rachel Qingzhu Zhang***

## Summary ##
This week I learned a lot from obstacles and failure.

First, I cannot adjust the parameters of the holder. If I change the width of the phone into 90mm, the holder will turn red (which may means that the phone intersects with the holder in the sketch).

Second, the use of the laser cutting machine is kind of confusing, especially for transmitting the sketches. Then with the instruction of Sudhu, we learned that we have to take a little trial on our board, for preventing problems during the laser cutting process. (The boards are really expensive!) Thanks to Sudhu, I learned a lot of special tricks.

I still have some questions about adjusting parameters and baking. Hope I can figure it out in Thursday’s class.


## Reflection ##
*Taking the first step is always challenging, just like my academic journey at Berkeley and also, navigating software learning. I aspired to take a bold leap initially, but it proved more difficult than anticipated.*

*When I first launched Grasshopper and was confronted by its intricate, "spaghetti"-like maps and countless parameters, I felt overwhelmed. The mere sight of the interface made me want to shut down my PC immediately. Yet, discovering tutorials on MDes’ GitHub repository gave a glimmer of hope. However, the sheer volume of tutorials — with each spanning nearly an hour — left me daunted and unsure of where to begin.*

So here is the reflection of how to learn new tools and kicking off a well-planned semester:

1. Get the Big Picture: Before diving in, I like to get a bird's-eye view of the software. Knowing its purpose, understanding its basic interface, and grasping the rationale behind its design can demystify the whole process.  A bit of familiarity can help reduce the initial apprehension and face the challenge with confidence. 

2. Learn by Comparing: Relate new tools to ones you already know.  Drawing parallels between the new and the familiar can be super helpful. (Like understanding Rhino by comparing it to Blender.)

3. Stay Organized: Jot down notes, make sketches, and bookmark important sites (like MDes Github wiki). I also keep my notes sorted into different files to keep my thoughts in order.

4. Ask Away:  It's easy to hold back from asking questions out of fear of being embarrassed or judged. But hey, I remind myself of the tuition I've paid — I deserve to get the most out of it! So, I've learned to be bold to ask around seeking clarity and instructions.

5. Value my dear Cohorts: For me, the cohorts are more than just classmates; they're also mentors. I'm proud to be part of such a supportive group, always ready to share and assist. Sometimes, I feel there's more to learn from them than even from our professors.


## Speculation ##
I think the phone case could be improved in several ways for better practicability:

1) When you're trying to put your phone in the case, you have to be really careful. If the case is made of a tough material, there's a chance that the phone screen might get scratched if you don't place it just right.

2) There's a problem with the parts of the case that hold the phone. They cover up some parts of the screen. This means when you're trying to record something, you can't see everything clearly because a part of the screen is hidden, so as to watch a video (therefore the using scenarios are very limited).

*like this*

4) The phone holder seems tailored for a specific user and perhaps a particular table. The big issue here is that you can't change the angle of the phone once it's in the holder. This isn't very convenient if you want to adjust the phone's position to get a better view.

*this is my phone stand which can adjust the angles for the view*
