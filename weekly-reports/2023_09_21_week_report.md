## Summary ##
This week I improved my cellphone stand redesign (with the help of the feedback from my cohorts).

I did not actually print my project in the video presentation session and in my feedback I saw that most of my cohorts in my group strongly suggested that I should print it out (I really appreciate that they love my design!), so i devote a great deal of time for 3D printing.

(1)The first result:
The first 3D printing result is not satisfying because I chose the configuration file for fast printing (fast but not in good quality) on the 3D printer, so the details were not printed well. Also, the slot is a little narrow, so it is hard to securely support the phone.

(2)The second result:
So I changed the size parameters in Grasshopper for better fitting the phone, and re-print my project in a finest configuration. The result looks nice and cute!

Using Scenarios: 
it can be used to place the phone vertically and horizontally

## Speculation ##

This project has been an enlightening experience, from pinpointing design challenges to immersing myself in Rhino+Grasshopper tutorials and hands-on work. The redesigned cellphone stand showcases a fusion of design, aesthetics, functionality, and tech. It's rewarding to see my digital designs materialize and become usable in everyday life. 

I really appreciate and cherish the feedback from my cohorts, and it is my pleasure that my project to be liked by most of them. (I am thinking to produce copies for presents to them!)
It really facilitate me in having a deeper understanding in computational design and also presentation skills.
