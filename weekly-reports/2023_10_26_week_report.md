Our additional functions: here are some optional functions we came up before, we can add these functions in the future for more functional use:

- Button Change Scale/record/save/show Chord
- Incorporating a learning mode where participants can learn about musical concepts through interactive gameplay.
- Allowing users to record, save, and share their musical creations.

Enhanced Sensory Integration: While the current design uses tactile and auditory elements, future iterations could incorporate other senses. Imagine a pillow that changes temperature in sync with the music, or one that emits subtle fragrances based on the tunes played. By appealing to multiple senses simultaneously, the experience becomes even more immersive and therapeutic.

Adaptive Learning Algorithms: With the integration of machine learning, the 'Musical Pillow' could observe and adapt to user preferences over time. For instance, if a user often creates melancholic tunes during rainy days, the pillow could suggest similar tunes or even offer contrasting upbeat melodies to elevate the user's mood during subsequent rainy sessions.

Collaborative Music Creation: In an era of connected devices, the 'Musical Pillow' could communicate with other pillows or musical devices in real-time. Picture a scenario where two friends, miles apart, engage in a 'duet', their respective pillows harmonizing with each other, bridging the physical distance with music.

Environment-responsive Modules: Embedding environment sensors (like temperature, humidity, or light sensors) could make the 'Musical Pillow' responsive to its surroundings. A sunny day might evoke cheerful, upbeat tunes, while a stormy night might result in dramatic, intense melodies.

Integration into the Larger Musical Ecosystem: The pillow, as a musical creation tool, could easily integrate with digital audio workstations (DAWs) or music-sharing platforms. This would allow users to not only create music but also effortlessly record, edit, and share their creations with a wider audience, fostering a community of 'Musical Pillow' composers and enthusiasts.

IV. Conclusion & Feedback

The 'Musical Pillow' project was more than a mere fusion of technology and music; it was a journey into redefining the boundaries of interactive design and pushing the envelope of what we perceive as play. In confronting and surmounting various challenges, from integrating intricate sensors to decoding the nuances of music theory, I gained invaluable insights into the symbiosis of design, technology, and human interaction. The project stands as a testament to the transformative power of innovation and the endless potential that awaits when we dare to reimagine the familiar. As I reflect on the endeavor, I'm reminded that in a rapidly evolving digital age, there remains an irreplaceable value in tactile experiences, genuine joy, and shared moments of creativity. The 'Musical Pillow' is not just a productâ€”it's a vision of a future where technology enhances, rather than replaces, the simple joys of human connection.

# Feedback

After reading the feedback, there are some parts that people value most:

- The concept of fish-inspired music through pillow interaction is seen as innovative and captivating.
- Design effectively hides the hardware, contributing to its aesthetic appeal.
- Successful and seamless integration of software and hardware.
- Commendation for the use of the accelerometer in tracking the pillow's movements.
- The fabrication process, blending sensor technology with user actions, is appreciated.
- The project demonstrates a deep understanding of music.
- It promotes community connections and engagements.
- Incorporating electronics into soft materials encourages user interaction.
- Future possibilities like controlling external music applications, e.g., adjusting Spotify volume, are seen as potential advantages.

And some aspects we should be aware of or to improve:
- There's a call for a broader and richer musical experience.
- Safety concerns have been raised, particularly around waterproofing.
- A need to consider a wider range of user scenarios for enhanced safety and experience.

Not just project 2
The skills and knowledge I've acquired have proven to be very valuable. I was able to incorporate some Max techniques along with digital music development elements into my Studio Foundation project, which involved creating a plant-synthesizer. This project was well-received, attracting the attention of many students and teachers who came to see it and take pictures. The digital tools significantly aided in expanding and applying what I had learned.

I am thrilled that Gia Kirk and Christine Marcelino have shown their strong interest in our project, particularly wanting to understand the musical aspect and requesting to view my files. Gia even scheduled a meeting with me to learn about Max and Arduino, which made me feel like an instructor giving office hours.
