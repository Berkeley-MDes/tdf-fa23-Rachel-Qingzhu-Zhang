# Pitch On Project 4

This week i presented two of my ideas on my final project. One is a more practical project: Digital Plate for Eating Disorders and Fitness, the other one is Prism: Wearable device for poly-music composition and visualization

For the first idea,it aims to develop an innovative digital plate designed to assist individuals with eating disorders and fitness enthusiasts. The plate will incorporate advanced technology to aid in managing eating habits and nutritional intake. 

the functions are:

Color-Changing Technology:
- Utilizes materials that change color to influence appetite and eating behavior.
- Aimed at creating a psychological impact on food consumption.

Nutrient Ratio Displays (Carbs/Fat/Protein/Fiber...):
- The plate will have designated partitions to display different nutrient ratios.
- Assists in meal planning for a balanced diet.

Companion App for Tracking and Analysis:
- A user-friendly app to track eating habits and nutritional intake.
- Features include meal logging, nutritional analysis, and progress tracking.

Detachable Small Saucer:
- Shaped like a cat's earüê±, designed for small snacks or portion control.
- Enhances the plate's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

And my second idea stems from the cover of Pink Floyd's album the dark side of the moon. Why Pink Floyd uses prism as their album cover? I looked up the answer:
- Visual Simplicity and Depth: It represents a transition from simplicity to complexity, much like life's journey.
- Spectrum of Light: The light spectrum in the prism signifies diversity and complexity arising from simplicity, a -metaphor for life's varied experiences and emotions.
- Unity and Dispersion: The light's journey through the prism reflects the album's themes: the stages and struggles of human life, moving from unity to diversity and back.

So inspired by these concept, i came up a device for music collaboration and light projection device, featuring:
- Collaborative Creation: Prisms connect wirelessly for synchronized music and color generation, promoting teamwork.
- Centralized Kaleidoscope Projection: A shared projection system aggregates inputs from multiple prisms, creating a large-scale kaleidoscopic light show in a communal space.
- Interactive Multiplayer Games: Design games or challenges that require collaborative effort to achieve specific musical or visual goals.
